I‚Äôve been a ChatGPT plus customer for over two years and during that time I've had over 1,300 conversations with it covering everything from local government and AI ethics to neurodivergence, coding, and digital tools.

Before OpenAI introduced the search feature I was getting frustrated with not being able to find some of the more interesting and useful conversations that I knew were lurking in there somewhere. Having given ChatGPT the classic "tell me something you know about me that I might not know about myself" prompt I was also curious about the patterns in the the corpus and what insights into my thinking and interests I could glean from it.

I'd also been dabbling with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for note taking and pondering [second brain learning theory](https://petermeglis.com/blog/unlock-your-brains-potential-a-beginners-guide-to-obsidian-and-building-a-second-brain/).

Then I discovered Superkikim's [Nexus AI Chat Importer](https://github.com/Superkikim/nexus-ai-chat-importer) plugin for Obsidian.

This worked great, but the graph of the imported chats looked like a dandelion seed, with everything connected to a central index but no interrelationships. I wasn't about to go through over 1000 chats and manually link them, surely there's a smarter way to do this?

So I built something. Or rather we, ChatGPT and I, did. 

I was trained in coding in the early 90s but never really put it into action, becoming an IT generalist early in my career. However, in the last few years I've had the privilige to lead a team of talented developers which has led me back into the deeper tech side of things, wrangling with devops and cloud architecture, and rekindled an interest in coding. I'll never be as good a coder as the rest of the team but using gen-AI and applying over 30 years of knowledge I've got a few tricks up my sleeve. 

This project has been around a while but I finally got it dusted off and updated the repo, learning a few things about git, VScode, GitHub copilot and dipping a toe into a few other things like Jekyll static websites and Ruby in the process.



## üõ† What we Built

Two Python scripts:

1. **`main.py`** ‚Äî finds semantic similarity between markdown files and links them together with Obsidian-style `[[wikilinks]]`.
2. **`tagger.py`** ‚Äî assigns smart tags to each file based on similarity to a predefined list of thematic tags.

The goal? Build a **self-organising knowledge graph** out of exported ChatGPT markdown files.

## üí° How It Works

- Uses [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) to generate embeddings
- Caches embeddings for performance
- Calculates pairwise cosine similarity
- Adds Obsidian-style `[[links]]` to the bottom of each file
- Uses YAML frontmatter for tags (via `tagger.py`)
- Runs locally with GPU support (tested on RTX 4070 in a Lenovo Legion Slim 5)

## üì∏ Here's the Result

^ This is a visualisation of my Obsidian vault after running the script ‚Äî showing clusters of related notes linked by meaning, not keywords.

^ And this is the first conversation I had on 9 Feb 2023, one of the more connected nodes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example Usage

```bash
python main.py vault_path \
  --clusters 40 \
  --similarity 0.6 \
  --title-weight 0.4 \
  --content-weight 0.6 \
  --batch-size 32 \
  --min-links 1 \
  --max-links 9 \
  --delete-links \
  --apply-links \
  --force-embeddings \
  --model gtr-x5-l
```

```bash
python tagger.py vault_path \
  --tags-file tags.txt \
  --apply-tags \
  --force-embeddings
```

## üß† Why This Matters

This is about uncovering patterns in how you think. When ChatGPT helps you ideate or explain something, that output shouldn‚Äôt be stuck on OpenAI's servers or vanish into a markdown graveyard. It should become part of a living, evolving knowledge network.

By letting AI link your own AI-generated content, you turn your conversations into a map of your intellectual journey.

And when visualised in Obsidian's graph view you get an intuitively explorable map of your AI-enhanced second brain.

## üß™ What might come next

- Visual overlays of cluster topics in the graph
- GPT-generated summaries
- Semantically discovered hierearchical categories
- Time-aware linking (chronological progression of ideas)
- Interface it with Obsidian Canvas

I‚Äôm thinking of turning this into an Obsidian plugin. If you think that sounds useful, let me know. Likewise, drop me a DM if you have ideas about where we could take this or what you could apply it to.
