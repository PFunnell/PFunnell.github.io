![The search for meaning](/assets/images/explorer.png)

Over the past year, I‚Äôve had over 1,300 conversations with ChatGPT ‚Äî covering everything from local government and AI ethics to neurodivergence, coding, and digital tools.

Before OpenAI introduced the search feature I was getting frustrated with not being able to find some of the cool conversations I recalled having. Having given ChatGPT the classic "tell me something you know about me that I might not know about myself" prompt I was also curious about what the overall content of the corpus was and what insights I could glean from it.

So I built something. Or rather we, ChatGPT and I, did, before anyone was talking about 'vibe coding' let alone 'lego coding'



## üõ† What we Built

Two Python scripts:

1. **`main.py`** ‚Äî finds semantic similarity between markdown files and links them together with Obsidian-style `[[wikilinks]]`.
2. **`tagger.py`** ‚Äî assigns smart tags to each file based on similarity to a predefined list of thematic tags.

The goal? Build a **self-organising knowledge graph** out of exported ChatGPT markdown files.

---

## üí° How It Works

- Uses [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) to generate embeddings
- Caches embeddings for performance
- Calculates pairwise cosine similarity
- Adds Obsidian-style `[[links]]` to the bottom of each file
- Uses YAML frontmatter for tags (via `tagger.py`)
- Runs locally with GPU support (tested on RTX 4070 in a Lenovo Legion Slim 5)

## üì∏ Here's the Result

![Obsidian graph view](/assets/images/metisem1.png)

^ This is a visualisation of my Obsidian vault after running the script ‚Äî showing clusters of related notes linked by meaning, not keywords.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example Usage

```bash
python main.py vault_path \
  --clusters 40 \
  --similarity 0.6 \
  --title-weight 0.4 \
  --content-weight 0.6 \
  --batch-size 32 \
  --min-links 1 \
  --max-links 9 \
  --delete-links \
  --apply-links \
  --force-embeddings \
  --model gtr-x5-l
```

```bash
python tagger.py vault_path \
  --tags-file tags.txt \
  --apply-tags \
  --force-embeddings
```

---

## üß™ What's Next

- Visual overlays of cluster topics in the graph
- GPT-generated summaries or categories
- Time-aware linking (chronological progression of ideas)
- Interface it with Obsidian Canvas

I‚Äôm thinking of turning this into a packaged tool ‚Äî maybe even a plugin. If that sounds useful, let me know.

## üîñ Bonus: Tags I Use

My `tags.txt` includes things like:

- `ai_and_automation`
- `neurodivergence`
- `ethics_and_policy`
- `education`
- `arts_and_cognition`
- `system_design`

Each one maps to a description and is matched semantically ‚Äî not by string matching ‚Äî which feels like the future of note organisation.

Let me know if you're trying to tame a similar pile of markdown chaos.
