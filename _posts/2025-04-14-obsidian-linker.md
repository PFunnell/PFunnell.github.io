![The search for meaning](/assets/images/explorer.png)

Over the 2 years I‚Äôve had over 1,300 conversations with ChatGPT covering everything from local government and AI ethics to neurodivergence, coding, and digital tools.

Before OpenAI introduced the search feature I was getting frustrated with not being able to find some of the more interesting and useful conversations. Having given ChatGPT the classic "tell me something you know about me that I might not know about myself" prompt I was also curious about the overall content of the corpus and what insights I could glean from it.

So I built something. Or rather we, ChatGPT and I, did. This has been around a while but I finally got it dusted off and updated the repo.



## üõ† What we Built

Two Python scripts:

1. **`main.py`** ‚Äî finds semantic similarity between markdown files and links them together with Obsidian-style `[[wikilinks]]`.
2. **`tagger.py`** ‚Äî assigns smart tags to each file based on similarity to a predefined list of thematic tags.

The goal? Build a **self-organising knowledge graph** out of exported ChatGPT markdown files.

---

## üí° How It Works

- Uses [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) to generate embeddings
- Caches embeddings for performance
- Calculates pairwise cosine similarity
- Adds Obsidian-style `[[links]]` to the bottom of each file
- Uses YAML frontmatter for tags (via `tagger.py`)
- Runs locally with GPU support (tested on RTX 4070 in a Lenovo Legion Slim 5)

## üì∏ Here's the Result

^ This is a visualisation of my Obsidian vault after running the script ‚Äî showing clusters of related notes linked by meaning, not keywords.

^ And this is the first conversation I had on 9 Feb 2023, one of the more connected nodes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example Usage

```bash
python main.py vault_path \
  --clusters 40 \
  --similarity 0.6 \
  --title-weight 0.4 \
  --content-weight 0.6 \
  --batch-size 32 \
  --min-links 1 \
  --max-links 9 \
  --delete-links \
  --apply-links \
  --force-embeddings \
  --model gtr-x5-l
```

```bash
python tagger.py vault_path \
  --tags-file tags.txt \
  --apply-tags \
  --force-embeddings
```

## üß™ What might come next

- Visual overlays of cluster topics in the graph
- GPT-generated summaries
- Semantically discovered hierearchical categories
- Time-aware linking (chronological progression of ideas)
- Interface it with Obsidian Canvas

I‚Äôm thinking of turning this into an Obsidian plugin. If you think that sounds useful, let me know.

Let me know if you're trying to tame a similar pile of markdown chaos.
